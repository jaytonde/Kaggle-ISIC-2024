# Kaggle-ISIC-2024-

This is the experimentation pipeline I have used in ISIC 2024 kaggle competition. This was binary image classification problem and we has to classify the given in Binary class {0: benign, 1: malignant}.
main.py and main_hybrid.py files contains all the code of pipeline which is fully autumated to download dataset and start the experiment.
I have created the seperate yaml file to define configurations for each model.
